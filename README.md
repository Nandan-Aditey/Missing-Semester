# Missing-Semester
Databased's Missing Semester sessions, inspired from MIT OCW [Missing Semester](https://missing.csail.mit.edu) course, where we learn about basics every developer should know like using command-line, text editors, use fancy features of version control systems, and much more!

We like to call it each session with a fancy session code(based on topics) - DBD001, DBD002, etc.

## Sessions

- DBD001 - Introduction to Linux and Shells
- DBD002 - Introduction to Debuggers and Testing
